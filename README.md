# Own-Game
This repository contains all the materials required for Project 2 of the subject Fundamentals of Game Development coursed in LUT during the Autumn fall, 2019. 
My own-game created with Unity along with its playable folders (and source codes), a 60s teaser trailer and the GDD of the game I submitted in my repository Unity-tutorial-projects can be found in this Own Game repository.
